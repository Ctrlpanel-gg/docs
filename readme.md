# Controlpanel Docs
The official controlpanel docs. in the root directory, I’ve included a simple node.js web server for easy deployment. for local development, you can just hop into the 'docs' folder and run the local dev server.

## Local development
### install node_modules for docs
```bash
cd docs/
npm install
```

### run development server
```bash
npm run start
```

## Docs made with Docusaurus
