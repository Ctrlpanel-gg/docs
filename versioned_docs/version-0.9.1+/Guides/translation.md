# Adding Translation Files

:::warning

Not all languages are fully translated. If you want to assist with translating, please read [this](/docs/Contributing/translate)
:::

All translated files can be found [here](https://github.com/1day2die/cpgg_lang/tree/main/translated)

### How to Install

Download the needed language file and put it in `/var/www/controlpanel/resources/lang`

To activate the language, go to your dashboard settings and change the Language setting accordingly. You can also go directly to it by using this:

```YOUR_DASHBOARD.com/admin/settings#language```
