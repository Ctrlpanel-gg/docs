# Translating

You can speak your mother tongue?<br/>
You understand a certain language very well?<br/>
Then we need exactly **you for our translator team!**<br/>

After a long wait, the Ctrlpanel has now been equipped with a translation system.<br/>

_Now we need people who help us translate!_<br/>

## How to help

The Translation list can be found here
https://crowdin.com/project/controlpanelgg

On this Website you will see every language we need to translate and the current progress.
Feel free to contribute or correct any language you know.

If you have a suggestion for a language or want to bring in your skills on a certain language, feel free to contact us on discord!
