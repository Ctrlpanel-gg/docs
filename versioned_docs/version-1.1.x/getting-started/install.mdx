Creating a hosting is a serious responsibility, including **legal liability** - it requires solid knowledge of **network infrastructure**, **Linux systems**, and related technologies.
If you don't know what you're doing, **don't do it**.

We also reserve the right to deny you support on our Discord server if you lack at least basic technical knowledge or understanding of what you're doing.

Installing CtrlPanel is fairly straightforward and not much different from setting up Pterodactyl. Our documentation is written for Debian-based systems. Be sure to read the comments for each command carefully, they often contain important information!
