## Database Setup

:::info
You will need a database setup and a database user with the correct permissions created for that database before
continuing any further.
:::

To make a database and database user, you can follow this guide.
This is for MySQL and MariaDB. Please change the `USE_YOUR_OWN_PASSWORD` part to your password. Also, 127.0.0.1 is for localhost.

```sql
# Enter to MySQL shell
mysql -u root -p
# or if you use MariaDB do
mariadb -u root -p

# Enter the following SQL commands
CREATE USER 'ctrlpaneluser'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'USE_YOUR_OWN_PASSWORD';
CREATE DATABASE ctrlpanel;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ctrlpanel.* TO 'ctrlpaneluser'@'127.0.0.1';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```
