### Installing Composer

_If you already have Pterodactyl installed, you can skip this step!_

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that allows us to ship everything you'll need code wise to operate the Panel. You'll
need composer installed before continuing in this process.

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```
