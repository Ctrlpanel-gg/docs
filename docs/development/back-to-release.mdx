# Rolling back to the release version

Unfortunately, it highly depends on the situation.

If you just installed the **development** version, have a database backup, and want to roll back do this:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

Next, follow the instructions for [restoring](/docs/guides/backup?db-state=existing#how-to-restore-database-backup) your database backup.

If a stable release is available and you're on development but behind, run:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

and follow the default upgrade guide
