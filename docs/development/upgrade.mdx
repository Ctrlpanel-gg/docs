# Update to development version

:::danger
Always backup your database and any code changes before updating! It's better to not need them, than to lose everything when you do. We've explained how to do that [here](/docs/guides/backup).

Without a backup, you won't be able to roll back without losing all your data.
:::

## Enable Maintenance Mode

```bash
cd /var/www/ctrlpanel
php artisan down
```

## Switching to development branch

```bash
git checkout development
```

## Pulling the New Files

```bash
git stash
git pull
chmod -R 755 /var/www/ctrlpanel
```

## Update Dependencies

```bash
COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1 composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

## Updating the Database

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

## Clear Compiled Template Cache

```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

## Set Permissions

```bash
# If using NGINX or Apache (not on CentOS):
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/ctrlpanel/

# If using NGINX on CentOS:
chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/ctrlpanel/

# If using Apache on CentOS
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/ctrlpanel/
```

## Restarting Queue Workers

After every update, you should restart the queue worker to ensure that the new code is loaded in and used.

```bash
php artisan queue:restart
```

## Disable Maintenance Mode

```bash
php artisan up
```
