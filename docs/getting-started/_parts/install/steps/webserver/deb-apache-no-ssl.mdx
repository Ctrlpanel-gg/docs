Before we setup the configuration, we have to delete Apache's default configuration. Run the command below to delete it.

```bash
a2dissite 000-default.conf
```

Once done, we now have to open the NGINX configuration file. This depends on your OS.

```bash
nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/ctrlpanel.conf
```

There, you want to paste in the configuration which is stated below. Be sure to change any `YOUR.DOMAIN.HERE` placeholders with your Ctrlpanel setup.

```conf title="/etc/apache2/sites-available/ctrlpanel.conf"
<VirtualHost *:80>
    # Replace YOUR.DOMAIN.HERE with your domain.
    ServerName YOUR.DOMAIN.HERE
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/ctrlpanel/public"

    AllowEncodedSlashes On

    php_value upload_max_filesize 100M
    php_value post_max_size 100M

    <Directory "/var/www/ctrlpanel/public">
        AllowOverride all
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Now that we've successfully created the configuration file for our web server, the last step is to restart it. **NOTE** This step can be skipped if your OS is based off of RHEL, Rocky Linux, or AlmaLinux.

```bash
# You do not need to run any of these commands on RHEL, Rocky Linux, or AlmaLinux
ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/ctrlpanel.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ctrlpanel.conf
a2enmod rewrite
systemctl restart apache2
```
