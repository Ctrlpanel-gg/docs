## Download Files

The first step in this process is to create the folder where the panel will live and then move ourselves into that
newly created folder. Below is an example of how to perform this operation.

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/ctrlpanel && cd /var/www/ctrlpanel
```

<Tabs groupId="version">
  <TabItem value="latest" label="Latest version">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ctrlpanel-gg/panel.git ./
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="specific" label="Specific version">
    :::info
    In this case, you'll need to use `git checkout main` or `git checkout NEW_VERSION` to upgrade.

    **Why?**  
    When you clone a repository at a specific tag, Git places you in a "detached HEAD" state - meaning you're not on any branch.  
    In this state, `git pull` wonâ€™t update anything because there's no branch to pull from.  
    To upgrade, you first need to switch to the branch or tag you want to use (for example, `git checkout main` or `git checkout NEW_VERSION`).
    :::

    If you want to install a specific version of CtrlPanel instead of the latest one, you'll need to specify the tag you want to clone from GitHub. Use the `-b <tag|branch_name>` argument for that. Replace `VERSION` with the version you want to install.

    ```bash
    git clone -b VERSION https://github.com/Ctrlpanel-gg/panel.git ./
    ```
