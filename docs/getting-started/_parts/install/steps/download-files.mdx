## Download Files

The first step in this process is to create the folder where the panel will live and then move ourselves into that
newly created folder. Below is an example of how to perform this operation.

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/ctrlpanel && cd /var/www/ctrlpanel
```

<Tabs groupId="version">
  <TabItem value="latest" label="Latest version">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ctrlpanel-gg/panel.git ./
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="specific" label="Specific version">
    If you want to install a specific version of CtrlPanel instead of the latest one, you'll need to specify the tag you want to clone from GitHub. Use the `-b <tag|branch_name>` argument for that. Replace `VERSION` with the version you want to install.

    ```bash
    git clone -b VERSION https://github.com/Ctrlpanel-gg/panel.git ./
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
