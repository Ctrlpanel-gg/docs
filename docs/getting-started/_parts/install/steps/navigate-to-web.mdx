## Navigate to the installer

To begin installation, go to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE.com/installer` and follow the installer instructions.

If you encounter problems with the email setup, you can skip it and set it up later.

Once the installer has been completed, you will be redirected to the login page. Sign in with your Pterodactyl username/email and the password you set during the installer.
