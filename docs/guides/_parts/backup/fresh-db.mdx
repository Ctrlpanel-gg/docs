Restore your backup:
> **Double-check that you placed the backup file in the `/var/www/ctrlpanel/` directory, and make sure you're using the correct file name**

```bash
# If you use MySQL
mysql -u root -p ctrlpanel < /var/www/ctrlpanel/backup.sql
# If you use MariaDB
mariadb -u root -p ctrlpanel < /var/www/ctrlpanel/backup.sql
```

If you have a backup from an older version of CtrlPanel, you have to migrate the database to the latest version.

```bash
cd /var/www/ctrlpanel
sudo php artisan migrate --seed --force
```
