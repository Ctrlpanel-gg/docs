## Create a theme

### Basic setup

Ctrlpanel.gg uses the module [laravel-themer](https://github.com/qirolab/laravel-themer).  
To start creating your own theme run the following command

```bash
php artisan make:theme
```

This will ask you some basic questions and will setup a base for you to start with.  

### Bladefiles & layout

Now you can find a copy of the original default theme files in the new folder the command above just created.  
You should start by modifying those two files first because those are responsible for the main layout of the dashboard.
`/themes/<YourThemeName>/views/layouts/app.blade.php`  
`/themes/<YourThemeName>/views/layouts/main.blade.php`  

### CSS

You can create a new folder in `/themes/<YourThemeName>/app.css` with your own custom CSS.  
Import the CSS in your blade files with the following line

```blade
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('themes/<YourThemeName>/app.css') }}">
```

and remove the line

```blade
@vite('themes/default/sass/app.scss')
```

### Sharing the theme (Optional)

Make sure you include both the `/themes` and `/public/themes` folder and a file to guide other users on how to install your theme.  
Keep the installation instructions as simple as possible and verify you didn´t forget anything, no matter how small the step might seem to you.

You can upload your theme to our [Market](https://market.ctrlpanel.gg/) or share it however you like.
